## Official Github

### Welcome!

This is the official Github for the Flint Hills Chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, located in Manhattan, KS. 

To learn more about the Flint Hills DSA Chapter, visit our website, which is linked above. Also make sure to follow us on your favorite social media to get updates and engage with us!

#### Purpose

Our GitHub space serves as the single source of truth for everything the Flint Hills DSA does and decides. Here you’ll find:

- **Governing documents** – bylaws, resolutions, working‐group charters

- **Meeting materials** – agendas, minutes, slide decks, sign-in sheets

- **Campaign plans & resources** – issue one-pagers, canvassing scripts, data dashboards

- **Educational content** – reading lists, study-group guides, workshop slide decks

- **Operational SOPs** – onboarding checklists, treasurer procedures, security protocols

Housing these materials in one place keeps members informed, lowers onboarding friction, and ensures we never lose institutional memory when leadership turns over.

#### Why GitHub?

1. **Radical transparency**. Public repos let all comrades—and the broader community—inspect, audit, and learn from our work. Private repos handle the handful of things that truly must stay confidential and private.

2. **Democratic collaboration**. Pull requests function like mini-proposals: anyone can suggest wording, data, or strategy changes; nothing is merged without collective review. Comments, reviews, and reaction emojis turn into a living dialogue—far more traceable than email threads.

3. **Version history = living history**. Git automatically records who changed what and why. Reverting mistakes or tracing the evolution of a policy is as simple as scrolling the commit log.

4. **Low-barrier participation**. Members who don’t “speak Git” can still click Edit → Propose changes in the web UI or leave feedback in Issues and Discussions. No special software required.

5. **Built-in automation**. GitHub Actions can publish our website, back up minutes as PDFs, or remind working groups of stale tasks—all without extra cost.

6. **Free and open-source ethos**. GitHub Free gives us unlimited public/private repos and collaborators, aligning perfectly with a grassroots budget.

In short, GitHub gives the chapter a transparent, participatory, and future-proof workspace that mirrors our socialist values!
